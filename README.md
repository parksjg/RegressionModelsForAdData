# Regression Models For Ad Data
This repository contains an R script (regressionModels.R) that performs various regression models on Facebook ad data. 

Models:
+ Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
+ Generalized Linear Models (GLM)
+ Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
+ AIC Model Selection
+ Principal Component Analysis and Principal Component Regression (PCA/PCR)
+ Bayesian Linear Regression

Data:
+ ad_report.csv -> primary data used in models
+ ad2_report.csv -> used for preliminary testing and result verification

Note: Model-Comparison-Results.pdf does not include in-depth analysis of results for all of the models performed in the script regressionModels.R. Also, the script should be run in sections, obviously, load the data first and then pick which model you wish to run.

For more information on what the data is and where it came from refer to the Introduction in Model-Comparison-Results.pdf
